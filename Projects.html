     <ul>
        <li> This website has been designed using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT that could be used by the Universities and Schools for
             the submission of Assignments by the students. The website has 2 modules namely "Faculty" and"Students".
        </li>
        <li> The new students and new faculty members have to first sign-up using the "Sign-up" link thereby taking them to their
             respective sign-up pages.
        </li>
        <li> Once a student has signed up they can login via their "ID" and "Password" and submit thier projects.
        </li>
        <li> Also a faculty has has ti login via their "ID" and "Password" and then they can view the projects submitted to them.
        </li>
        <li> "MY SQL" was used as the Database with "JAVA" as back-end for this Project.
        </li>
        <li> Different Sign-in modules are there for the faculties and students for different functions like 'Uploading the
             Assignments' for students and 'Grading the Assignment' for faculties so that they don't overlap with one or the other.
        </li>
